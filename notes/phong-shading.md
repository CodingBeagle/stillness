# Shading Techniques

## Flat Shading

Flat shading is a simple shading technique where each polygon of a 3D model is shaded with a single color. This color is typically determined by the angle between the polygon's normal and the light source direction. Flat shading does not interpolate colors across the surface, resulting in a faceted appearance.
